This is the repository for the keyboard configuration called luakh, which tries to be a good keymap
for a wide variety of keyboards for programmers mainly working with vim and emacs using the english
language as a base language.

In particular, this keymap suppose that the user outsources the foreign language capabilities
to the operating system at worst and to vim/emacs at best.
For hebrew and arabic, the developer uses [[https://github.com/alejandrogallo/qwerty-everywhere][qwerty-everywhere]] on emacs and vim.
